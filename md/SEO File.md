1.robots.txt – “Rules for Search Engines”

This file lives at:
https://bossbsynth.com/robots.txt

Purpose:
  Tells search engines like Google, Bing, etc. what they are allowed or not allowed to crawl

  Helps control what parts of your website are visible to search engines


# robots.txt
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Host
Host: https://bossbsynth.com

# Sitemaps
Sitemap: https://bossbsynth.com/sitemap.xml
```

✅ What’s good:
User-agent: * allows all search engines to crawl your site

Allow: / means they can crawl everything

Host: is optional but good to include

Sitemap: points to your main sitemap index file — ✅ perfect


# sitemap.xml

🗺️ sitemap.xml – “Master Index of All Sitemaps”

This is your main sitemap file, located at:
https://bossbsynth.com/sitemap.xml

✅ Purpose:
Acts like a table of contents for your site

Points to one or more detailed sitemap files (like sitemap-0.xml, sitemap-1.xml, etc.)

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sitemapindex xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://bossbsynth.com/sitemap-0.xml</loc>
  </sitemap>
</sitemapindex>
```
✅ This is exactly how a sitemap index should look. It tells Google to go check sitemap-0.xml.


# sitemap-0.xml

📄 sitemap-0.xml – “List of Your Actual Pages”
This file lists actual URLs that you want search engines to index.
Located at:
https://bossbsynth.com/sitemap-0.xml

✅ Purpose:
Provides the real list of URLs to crawl, like your homepage, project pages, blog posts, etc.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://bossbsynth.com</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-03-25T23:32:01.633Z</lastmod>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```
✅ Also perfect! It:
